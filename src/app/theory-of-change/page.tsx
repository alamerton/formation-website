              This page outlines Formation&apos;s theory of change. The purpose
              of the theory of change is to specify the activities conducted by
              the organisation, the intended effects of those activities, and
              the justification for the belief that those activities will bring
              about those effects.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The structure of a theory of change typically consists of a team
              or set of teams, a sphere of control, a sphere of influence, a
              sphere of interest, and a set of assumptions and evidence. This
              theory of change is subject to change as we learn more about what
              inputs best bring about the outcomes we are aiming for &mdash;
              reduced lock-in risk.

                Currently Formation is composed of two members, Alfie Lamerton
                and Adam Jones. Alfie is Formation&apos;s founder and research
                lead and Adam is an adviser to the organisation.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Alfie is the sole researcher and therefore the only member of
                Formation&apos;s research team. It is expected that as the
                organisation evolves, more teams will be created that contribute
                to the sphere of interest. Those teams will be added as new rows
                to the theory of change by mapping the causal pathway backwards
                from the intended impact to team design.
